* `ctrl h` - move left to left split
* `ctrl l` - move right to right split
* `ctrl k` - move up to top split
* `ctrl j` - move down to bottom split
* `<leader> b` - show buffer list [jeetsukumaran/vim-buffergator](https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/vim-buffergator)
* `gb` and `gB` to flip through the most-recently used buffer stack
